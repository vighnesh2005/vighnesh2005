## 💡 About Me  
I build systems that matter — from real-time video meetings to learning platforms powered by AI.  
My philosophy: *Clean architecture + meaningful user experience + scalable systems*.  
I’ve worked on:
- Real-time communications (WebRTC + Socket.io + mediasoup)  
- Full-stack web applications (Next.js / React + Node.js / Express + MongoDB / Supabase)  
- AI & knowledge-systems (PDF chatbot, flashcards, exam creation)  
I’m actively applying for remote full-stack development internships, and love teaming up on ambitious projects.
